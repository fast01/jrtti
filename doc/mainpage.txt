 * \section overview Overview
 *
 * jrtti is a C++ template library providing reflection capabilities for such programing language
 * 
 * jrtti provides abstraction for standard and custom C++ types and classes. This abstraction exposes class members
 * at run time, wich can be accessed by its string name.
 * 
 * It also provides a string representation of class members that can be used for object serialization and deserialization.

 * \section download Download
 *
 * You can get jrtti from GitHub at https://github.com/jseto/jrtti
 *
 * \section dependencies Dependencies
 *
 * \subsection boost Boost
 * jrtti uses header-only Boost C++ libraries. Download boost from http://www.boost.org/ and make sure your compiler have access to boost include directory.
 * subsection gtest gtest
 * jrtti test use gtest testing framework. If you plan to run the test download gtest from http://code.google.com/p/googletest/ and install it. 
 *
 * \section install Install
 * jrtti is a header-only library. Just make sure your compiler has access to jrtti include directory and add #include <jrtti/jrtti.hpp> to your 
 * source code. Make sure boost header file path is available to your project.
 *
 * \section example Example
 * 
 * This example shows the main capabilities and usage of jrtti. 
 * \see \ref sample.h 
 * \see and the tests.
 *
 * \include doc_sample.cpp
 *
 * \section tests Running the tests
 *
 * \subsection testWindows Windows
 *
 * There are VSC++ and Codegear project files under the test directory. As said above, test are coded 
 * using <a href="http://code.google.com/p/googletest/">gtest</a>. Install gtest in your system as well as boost libraries and add the following 
 * environment variables:
 * \li BOOST_ROOT -> points to your boost directory
 * \li GTEST_ROOT -> points to your gtest directory
 * 
 * \subsection testLinux Linux
 * 
 * There are no makefiles for Linux compilers, but the setup should be straight forward.
